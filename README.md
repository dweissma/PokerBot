# A Combined Network Approach to Texas Holdâ€™em
## Running the Project
First install the requirements. \
<code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code>
\
Next simply run Game.py \
<code>
python Game.py
</code>

To play against a different model open the Game.py file and change the model = "/params/model" to some other model.

## How it works 
The system uses a combined approach feeding a the result of a bayesian opponenet modeling algorithm into a neural network. The Bayesian portion works by first modeling the probability of each possible hand given that the player bet and then using these probabilities to calculate that a given player has a better hand than the AI given that they didn't fold. 

### Description of files

The Game.py file contains the implementation of a game of Texas Hold'em. The Player.py file defines an master player class which AI and User inherit from. The params folder contains the saved models from various training stages. The training folder contains data which was used to train the model. The other files are scripts which were used to train the network.
